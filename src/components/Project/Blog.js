        In 2024, I'm expanding my skills across diverse JavaScript frameworks
        like Solid.js and Next.js, creating projects to deepen my knowledge and
        stay versatile in web development. I'm intensively focusing on
        TypeScript to enhance code scalability and maintainability, making it a
        cornerstone of my development strategy for robust and efficient
        programming.

        <br />
        Professionally, I'm open to joining a forward-thinking company, ready to
        tackle challenging roles that leverage my skills and encourage growth.
        For me, 2024 is about embracing new technologies, pushing boundaries,
        and adapting to the dynamic landscape of web development.
